      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>Currently I'm working at Bad Dinosaur, a software agency in Edinburgh.
        Here I am currently leading a small design team while also doing
        day-to-day design work on client projects.</p>

      <p>In the past, I've worked on product teams as well as freelanced. I'm used to working
        at a fast-pace to get products out the door and into users' hands for testing.</p>

      <p>I've experience working in both product and marketing teams. I effictively
        communicate my ideas and justify my decisions to clients and colleagues. </p>

      <p>I love teaching what I know.
        I mentor junior designers on visual design as well as front-end code and user experience.
        In my current role I've also been sharing my knowledge of front-end code and design with
        the wider team, including back-end developers.</p>
