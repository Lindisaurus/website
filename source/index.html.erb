    <h3>Accountex silent film</h3>
    <p>Accountex is like Glastonbury for accountants. Every Accountex FreeAgent
      has a stand. On this stand there's televisions and when they're not
      being used for showing off the FreeAgent app they display a silent video
      explaining what we do and how great FreeAgent is</p>
    <p>This was my second time creating the video for Accountex. This year we had a
      slight rebrand of our accountants' facing marketing, so while not much of the
      content had changed the overall look changed quite significantly.</p>
    <p>
      In this version I was able to use our existing illustrations and animate them
      to convey our functionality and features.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also an example of just how much my animation chops have improved
       in a year!</p>

        <h3>Resources for accountants</h3>
        <p>At FreeAgent we had a lot of disparate content online but no central hub for it.
          Working with marketing we came up with one central page that would host
          all the resources we had that were relevant to accountants,
          including white papers, webcasts and infographics. </p>
        <p>
          The resources page uses Middleman and draws from a YAML file to
          populate the page. This was a good opportunity to sharpen my Ruby
          skills. I’m no software engineer but I now know a thing or two!
          Because it draws from a YAML file it’s easy for anybody to update,
          as long as they have some copy and an image to represent their resource.

    <h3>Dash</h3>
    <p>Dash started as a Trello board my boyfriend Murray and I kept
      to list things we wanted to do and things we had done</p>
    <p>One day I was sick off work and bored out of my mind and decided I'd try
      to learn some Ruby, so I built Dash which, using the Trello API
      took all the adventures and displayed them. There was even a little health
      meter that would deplete the longer we went without doing anything</p>
    <p>Dash has since been a React app, a Rails app and now is getting
      integrated into a whole dashboard that one day will be projected on a
      mirror, all sci-fi like. (I can't take credit for all this, Murray is a developer).
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now Dash has gone back to the drawing board but this is one of the
      screenshots from the initial development.

    <h3>Creative Edinburgh Awards GIF booth</h3>
      <p>This was a really interesting opportunity to design something really fun for
      the Creative Edinburgh Awards. We decided to create a GIF booth!</p>
      <p>For me this involved designing the backdrop for the GIFs, sourcing props
        from our existing illustrations and creating new illustrations (most notably
        a jammie dodger). </p>
      <p><small>Also worth note, the hardest physical labour I've ever had to do. Ever
        cut out several foamex boards with a tiny scalpel?
        There were blisters.</small></p>
