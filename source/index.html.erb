    <h3>Accountex silent film</h3>
    <p>Accountex is like Glastonbury for accountants. Every Accountex FreeAgent
      has a stand. On this stand there's televisions and when they're not
      being used for showing off the FreeAgent app they display a silent video
      explaining what we do and how great FreeAgent is</p>
    <p>This was my second time creating the video for Accountex. This year we had a
      slight rebrand of our accountants' facing marketing, so while not much of the
      content had changed the overall look changed quite significantly.</p>
    <p>
      In this version I was able to use our existing illustrations and animate them
      to convey our functionality and features.

<h2>Web design</h2>
<p class="lg-width--65pc">I do a shocking amount of making things look the same as they used to in my
  day-to-day job. From refactoring CSS to moving from a clunky CMS to a static
  site generator. I'm a proud owner of a Github profile with more deletions than
  additions. üéâ </p>

    <h3>Dash</h3>
    <p>Dash started as a Trello board my boyfriend Murray and I kept
      to list things we wanted to do and things we had done</p>
    <p>One day I was sick off work and bored out of my mind and decided I'd try
      to learn some Ruby, so I built adventure time which, using the Trello API
      took all the adventures and displayed them. There was even a little health
      meter that would deplete the longer we went without doing anything</p>
    <p>Dash has since been a React app, a Rails app and now is getting
      integrated into a whole dashboard that one day will be projected on a
      mirror, all sci-fi like. (I can't take credit for all this, Murray is a developer).

<h2>Print</h2>
<p class="lg-width--65pc">I'm proud to say, as someone who mostly works on the web, I have endured
  the fear of sending something off to print and survived. ‚úåüèΩ

    <h3>Creative Edinburgh Awards GIF booth</h3>
      <p>This was a really interesting opportunity to design something really fun for
      the Creative Edinburgh Awards. We decided to create a GIF booth!</p>
      <p>For me this involved designing the backdrop for the GIFs, sourcing props
        from our existing illustrations and creating new illustrations (most notably
        a jammie dodger). </p>
      <p><small>Also worth note, the hardest physical labour I've ever had to do. Ever
        cut out several foamex boards with a tiny scalpel?
        There were blisters.</small></p>
