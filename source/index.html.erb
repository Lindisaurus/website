        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>Currently I'm working at Bad Dinosaur, a software agency in Edinburgh.
          Here I am currently leading a small design team while also doing
          day-to-day design work on client projects.</p>

        <p>In the past, I've worked on product teams as well as freelanced. I'm used to working
          hard to get products out the door and into users' hands for testing.</p>

        <p>I've experience working in both product and marketing teams. I enjoy both
        and the relationship between them. </p>

        <p>I love teaching what I know.
          I mentor junior designers on visual design as well as front-end code and user experience.
          In my current role I've been sharing my knowledge of front-end code and design with
          the wider team, including back-end developers.</p>

        <p>I'm also on <a href="http://instagram.com/spiffingspandex">Instagram</a> where I mostly
          post photos of my dog, Duncan, and the occasional photo of my baking.</p>
