        <h2>A small agency with a personal touch</h2>
        <p>Before I joined Bad Dinosaur was an agency of just two
          developers. The website had been quickly put together
          by them in little time</p>

        <p>The old website was full of stock photography and icons.
          We wanted to make it more "Bad Dinosaur". Bad Dinosaur
          is a small agency with a personal touch and we wanted
          the website to convey that. </p>

        <p>Since Bad Dinosaur work with a lot of people without a background
          in tech we needed the branding to focus more on product and process than
          on technology</p>

      <h2>Colours</h2>
      <p>The old branding used a lot of colour, often using it to differenciate
        different services or products. As part of the rebranding we'd decied to use
        imagery instead of colour for this so I created a limit pallete that would
        make our brand quickly recognisable.</p>

      <p>The two main colours were a dark navy and a turquoise. The two colours
        work well together and weren't so playful they couldn't be used in important
        documents or on office walls </p>

      <p>A secondary pallete was produced to ensure any illustrations looked
        on brand without being limited by just a few colours</p>

        <h2>Logo</h2>
        <p>As part of the new branding we needed a new logo. The old one no longer fitted with our playful new style. The logo was a good opportunity to hint at the dinosaur in the name without
          the whole brand being over-saturated by dinosaurs </p>

        <p>We went through a few iterations of the logo. We had a few claws that looked like giraffes, a few very happy and not-at-all-bad looking Dinosaurs. We settled on one that looked serious but still playful. As it was a small space we couldnâ€™t get too detailed or realistic so we went for a simple silhouette of a vaguely diplodocus looking Dinosaur.</p>

        <p>Creating the logo was an iterative process and I produced well over fifty different, small
          iterations. Nothing was ever deleted and inspiration came from all the previous versions</p>

      <h2>Imagery</h2>
      <p>Illustration was a great way to get our processes and ideas across without
        going into any technical detail. I chose a style that was flat and made of simple shapes. A style that could be taken by other designers in the team and replicated. </p>

      <p>Throughout our website we also made sure to use photos of the team,
        reassuring visitors that we were a small, close-knit team and not a
        huge studio full of faceless developers and designers</p>
