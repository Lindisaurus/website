      <h2>A small agency with a personal touch</h2>
      <p>Before I joined Bad Dinosaur was an agency of just two
        developers. The website had been quickly put together
        by them in little time</p>

      <p>The old website was full of stock photography and icons.
        We wanted to make it more "Bad Dinosaur". Bad Dinosaur
        is a small agency with a personal touch and we wanted
        the website to convey that. </p>

      <h2>Playful, human and not too techy</h2>
      <p>We took to the whiteboard first, identifying all the areas to focus on.
      This included imagery, type, logo, merchandise and colour. </p>

      <p>We identified exactly how we wanted Bad Dinosaur to come across.</p>

      <h3> Playful yet trustworthy</h3>
      <p> we‚Äôre obviously quite playful with a name like Bad Dinosaur but we‚Äôre also a trustworthy business partner for your business. We didn‚Äôt want to shout ‚ÄúDINOSAUR‚Äù at every opportunity but we wanted the playful nature of the company to shine through.</p>

      <h3>Human</h3>
      <p>We‚Äôre a small team of people who you‚Äôre going to get to know well doing business with. We wanted to show photos of real people who work at Bad Dinosaur. </p>

      <h3>Product-focused</h3>
      <p>We‚Äôre not going to bog you down with jargon and every process is clear and easy to understand. We don‚Äôt emphasise specific technology, we emphasise product and product design. </p>
